** Restaurant_Analysis_ML_Project
End-to-end machine learning project including regression, classification, recommendation systems, and geospatial analysis.
 Restaurant Analytics & ML Project  
Cognifyz Data Science Internship**

This project includes four end-to-end machine learning tasks performed on a restaurant dataset.

**Restaurant Rating Prediction (Regression)**
- Built a Random Forest regression model to predict restaurant ratings.
- Evaluated using MSE and R² score.
- Analyzed feature importance.

**Restaurant Recommendation System**
- Implemented a content-based filtering system.
- Recommended restaurants based on cuisine, city, and price range.

**Cuisine Classification (Multi-class Classification)**
- Developed a Random Forest classifier.
- Handled class imbalance.
- Achieved ~40% accuracy across highly imbalanced cuisine categories.
- Accuracy significantly outperformed random baseline.
** Location-Based Analysis**
- Analyzed restaurant distribution by city.
- Computed average ratings by location.
- Visualized insights using matplotlib & seaborn.

**Technologies Used**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Key Insights
- Restaurant ratings are influenced by price range, votes, and city.
- Cuisine classification is challenging due to 119 highly imbalanced categories.
- Location plays a strong role in restaurant density and rating trends.
